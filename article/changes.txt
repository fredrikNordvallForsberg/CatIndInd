FNF 2011-05-15:
* Changed author order back to ... Morris, Nordvall Forsberg, ...
  -- N comes after M

* Changed notation: Arg_B -> Arg, Arg_B'' -> Arg_B
  Also replaced Lemma 2.4 with the "convention" Arg = (Arg_A, Arg_B).

* Rephrased Arg_B on p. 2 slightly.

* Changed title of Sec. 2.3 and rephrased second last paragraph as a proposition.

* Changed "blocks of text" type declarations of elim_... to a rule formulation to make
  it look less overwhelming. [On the other hand, are rules scary for the less logically
  inclined?]

FNF 2011-05-16:
* Added some sentences describing the results at start of Section 3.

* Added paragraph about conjectured reduction to W-types to conclusion.

* Added paragraph at end of Section 1.1 about difference ind.-ind. and ind.-rec.
  (Removed categories with families waffle from jsut before Section 1.1 to make it fit.)
